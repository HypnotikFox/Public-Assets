Hi! I'm Hypnotik Fox, a brazilian game dev and part-time student!

Here I have some free public assets that I created/modified, targeted on game development for unity, that you can freely use on your own projects, study or modify.
I also have a list links of some other useful tools for game dev: https://github.com/HypnotikFox/Public-Assets/blob/main/Recommendations.md
